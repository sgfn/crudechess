# crudechess - a (hopefully) worthy successor to ownchess (CLI chessboard)

New&Improved! (now in C++ and with a proper build system, maybe even some unit tests)

Chess engine in the works, will come some time in the future, I promise

## Build
Linux only for now. Requirements: cmake, gcc

`./run`

## Run
`./bin/crudechess` - run board in interactive mode (`h` for help)

`./bin/crudechess PERFT_FILE PERFT_DEPTH` - run batch perft (e.g. `./bin/crudechess ./perft/data/perft_mini 4`)

## Test
WIP
